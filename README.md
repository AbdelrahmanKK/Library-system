# library system console application

this Project is a practice on Object oriented programming using java

## how to use
first you will need to insert the capacity of the library.
in this program you will be able to do so many features.
first : enter your name ....and thus you will be the first user in the library.
As a user you will have several options :
- ("1 for book insertion "); //insert a book to the library and all users can access book insertion

- ("2 to borrow a book");//if the user wants to borrow a book

- ("3 to return a book");if the user wants to return a book

- ("4 for searching for a particular book");

- ("5 to display certain book details like Title,Author,Number of copies ....etc");

- ("6 to delete a copy of a book");  Note: all users can access copy deletion

- ("7 to insert new user"); for adding new user to the library

- ("8 to show the users");

- ("9 to switch user");for switching between the users

for example : if we have 3 users ,tarek ,abbas and hatem.
each one can borrow and return books.
All we have to do is to switch to the user we want to use.
- ("10 to show borrowed books of tha user") this will show the borrowed books of the current user
- ("11 to show current user");this will display the name of the current user 
- ("12 to delete user");
- ("-1 to exit the program");
